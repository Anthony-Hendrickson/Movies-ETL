I did not get past #18 on the ETL_clean_kaggle_data on this week's assignment. I also couldn't push to github. 

Tried using the instructions listed here (https://medium.com/junior-dev/how-to-use-git-lfs-large-file-storage-to-push-large-files-to-github-41c8db1e2d65) but I guess I 
didn't know how to make this apply to a situation where I had to apply it to multiple files over 100 mb because i couldn't get it to work.
